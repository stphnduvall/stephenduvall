This is the source code for my website blah blah blah.

Currently trying to learn about React so thats what this branch is for.
I am working through this awful process of trying to hack shit to make it work.
I understand there is a very high likelihood that I am doing this in a completely incorrect way. But who knows, maybe there's a hint of correctness to the crappy code I have written.

I think I have a good framework written to generate my components and stuff like that, now I need to style the shit out of the page and hopefully make something that doesn't look too bad.

So what I will do is write a ton of html that looks nice and get it all purdy, then I will take the new snippets and copy the bits I need to put in the react code.

After I get that squared away, I'm going to redo the project structure and how node and all that shit works.
