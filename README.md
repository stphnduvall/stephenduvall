# Stephen DuVall
Source code for my personal website [stephenduvall.me]("https://stephenduavll.me")

It's built with typescript and react. I am still learning how to use react so
there is lots of room for this site to improve.

## To do:
- [ ] Create markdown parser
- [ ] Use markdown files instead of hard coded in the Javascript.
