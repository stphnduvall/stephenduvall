# Stephen DuVall
This is my personal webiste. It was based off the greyscale bootstrap template that I found on the internet.

I'm redesigning it myself to use flexbox and css grid without using any dependacy on bootstrap.

Im not the best web developer and thats why I'm trying to not use bootstrap. I probably have a lot of things wrong on this site and there's still more for me to learn.
