# Stephen DuVall
This is my personal webiste. It was based off the greyscale bootstrap template that I found on the internet.

I'm redesigning it myself to use flexbox and css grid without using any dependacy on bootstrap.

There's a lot of work that needs to get done on this site since I decided to rebuild it.

## ToDo:
- [ ] Add content to all sections
- [ ] Add parallax scrolling to the images
- [ ] Add a navbar with scroll spy that jumps to different sections
- [ ] Add links to gaming servers
- [ ] Add wishlist page **ASAP!!!**
- [ ] figure out what `package-lock.json` is for and if I should commit it
